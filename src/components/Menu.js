                     Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flattened base                         
                     of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, 
                     and often various other ingredients, which is then baked at a
                      high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. A small
                       pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta.</p>
